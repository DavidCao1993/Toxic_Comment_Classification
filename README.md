# Toxic_Comment_Classification
My Trial to tackle the Kaggle Toxic Comment Classification Competition 

I built a model that calculates the probability of a comment belonging to any of the mentioned classes, I used XGBoost after generating feature vectors using GLove and Google news Word2Vec

I got a total AUC of 0.82
